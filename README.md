# House prices prediction
In this notebook, i predicted house prices using 7 regression algorithms: <br>
>Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR)<br>

>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)<br>

>Decision Trees<br>

>Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>

>Gradient Boosting

>Random Forest Regressor

>ElasticNet

The project involves: 
preprocess and visualize the data, train each model, evaluate their performance using RMSE and R^2, analyze the results and submit the best model (Gradient Boosting).
